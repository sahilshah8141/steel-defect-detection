## üìù Description
- In this project, I have used the **Inceptionv3** and **Inception v4** model with transfer learning for steel defect detection.
- You can check out the deployed web application on http://steeldefect.herokuapp.com/ which runs the lightweight v3 model (**Testing image:** https://res.cloudinary.com/dnz9tlf5t/image/upload/v1645286147/hvknl7w2le3tbss6pjkx.jpg).

## ‚è≥ Dataset
- For the training, I have used the dataset of the Kaggle competition hosted by Severstal.
- You can check out the competition by below-mentioned link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/severstal-steel-defect-detection/data

## :desktop_computer: Download Pre-trained Model
I have uploaded the whole model on github with git lfs and you just have to run below command :-
```bash
$  git lfs pull --include=models/inceptionv3.h5
$  git lfs pull --include=models/inceptionv4.h5
```

## :gear: Setup
There are two requirements files for the specific web-application deployment and one for the Model training Notebook.
 
1. Install the dependencies for the web application:-
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```
2. Install the dependencies for the training notebook:-
```bash
$ pip install -r notebook-requirements.txt

```
